# Disable W01 (bool_comparison) lint
# This lint warns against `x == true` or `x == false` comparisons.
# However, we intentionally use `x == false` in some assertions for
# null-safety: `!null` throws an error, but `null == false` returns false.
# This allows assertions to fail gracefully when values are unset.
