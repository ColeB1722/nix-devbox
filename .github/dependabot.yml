# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
#
# This configuration automatically creates PRs to update GitHub Actions
# versions, keeping CI tooling current with security fixes and features.
#
# Workflow integration:
#   - Dependabot creates PRs targeting the default branch (main)
#   - PRs trigger ci-quick job (format + check)
#   - Branch protection requires CI to pass before merge
#
# Why only github-actions?
#   - Nix flake inputs are managed via `nix flake update` (see justfile)
#   - Future: Consider DeterminateSystems/update-flake-lock for automated
#     flake.lock updates (see docs/future-enhancements.md)
